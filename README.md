One thing I learned from the reading was how the process of displaying graphics has changed with computers. The reading showed the early model where the display
processor did all the work, but the new modern approach is a pipeline design that delegates tasks in order to maximize efficiency. A second thing I learned from
the reading was that matrices are used in the pipeline design as a way to show changes in the coordinate system.
